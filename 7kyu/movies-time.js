// You just started working at a local cinema, and your first task is to write a function that returns the showtimes of a specific movie,
// given its length. In order to make your job easier, you will work with 24-hour format throughout this kata.
// Your function receives three parameters, all of them being integers:
// open - Hour at which the cinema opens.
// close - Hour at which the cinema closes.
// length - Length of the movie, in minutes.
// It must return an array of times, with each time being in the format (hour, minute). For example, (19, 30) means 19:30, and (2, 0) means 02:00. The last session in the array cannot end after the cinema closes. Also, the times in the array must be sorted from earliest to latest.

// There's also a 15-minute window between a session's end and the beginning of the following one, in order to give enough time for users to take a seat.

// For example, for a cinema opening at 13:00 and closing at 23:00 showing a 60-minute movie, your function must return the following array:
// >>> movie_times(13, 23, 60)
// [(13, 0), (14, 15), (15, 30), (16, 45), (18, 0), (19, 15), (20, 30), (21, 45)]
// Note that the cinema might close at times such as 02:00 or 03:00, meaning examples like this must also work:

// >>> movie_times(16, 3, 75)
// [(16, 0), (17, 30), (19, 0), (20, 30), (22, 0), (23, 30), (1, 0)]
// IMPORTANT: For languages other than Python, just return an array of arrays. See sample test cases for more info on how to return the list of times.

// NOTE: This kata isn't meant to be too challenging, so opening times for all tests will be 12:00 or later, and closing times will always be 6:00 or earlier.

// NOTE 2: Midnight will be represented as (0, 0) or 0:00 in this kata, instead of 24:00.

//   let range = close - open;

//   for (let i = 1; i < range; i++) {
//     let num = Math.floor((open * 60 + min) / 60);

//     if (((open * 60 + min) / 60) < close - length / 60) {
//       arr.push([num, min % 60]);
//       min += length + 15;
//     }
//   }
//   return arr.map((v) => (v[0] >= 24 ? [v[0] - 24, v[1]] : [v[0], v[1]]));
